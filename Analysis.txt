üéØ Project Purpose
The purpose of the Digital Clock project is to develop a reliable and user-friendly system that accurately displays real-time information, including time and date. It serves as a modern solution for time management, offering users customizable features and seamless accessibility across platforms such as desktop, mobile, or embedded devices.

‚úÖ Project Requirements
1. üì¶ Functional Requirements
Core Features:
 Display current time (hours, minutes, seconds)

 Display current date (day, month, year)

 Display AM/PM or 24-hour format (user preference)

 Automatic syncing with system time

User Interface:
 Digital-style clock interface

 Intuitive and clean layout

 Real-time updates without needing refresh/reload

 Toggle between themes (dark/light)

Customization:
 User can choose between 12-hour or 24-hour format

 Choose date format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY)

 Option to show/hide seconds

 Time zone selection (if not syncing with system)

2. üí° Non-Functional Requirements
 Must respond in real time with less than 1-second lag

 Must be responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop

 Must be accessible (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)

 Cross-platform compatibility (web, mobile, and optionally embedded)

 Low resource consumption

 High reliability with no downtime for local version

 Language/localization support (optional)

3. üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
Frontend (if web-based):
 HTML/CSS/JavaScript

 Optional frameworks: React, Vue, or Svelte

 Real-time updates using JavaScript (setInterval() or similar)

Embedded Devices (if hardware implementation):
 Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

 RTC (Real-Time Clock) Module

 LCD/LED display

 Power-efficient design

4. üîê Security & Privacy
 No sensitive data collected or stored

 Safe from script injection or browser-related vulnerabilities

 Lightweight and privacy-focused implementation
